# odin-recipes
# This project is my first html project through the Odin Project!
# For this project, I used basic elements of html including img, href,
# headers, paragraphs, etc. This is also my first time uploading and using git
# and github together. I'm still figuring out when and how to commit well, but
# I attempted to add a little more commits to catch some different 'snapshots'.
# I hope you enjoy the little recipes I put together (I dont cook)!
