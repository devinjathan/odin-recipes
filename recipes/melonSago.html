        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The melon sago is a dessert I found recently that I fell in love with.
            I like to think of this like a creamy melon cold soup. This dessert is also very
            easy to make and requires little effort for a delictable treat. If you love
            honeydew, this is a perfect summer (or whenever!) dessert.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ready to eat Honeydew</li>
            <li>Sago/Tapioca pearls</li>
            <li>Nata de coco</li>
            <li>Coconut pudding</li>
            <li>Melon milk (<i>I reccomend Binggrae brand!</i>)</li>
            <li>Evaporated milk</li>
            <li>Condensed milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To start, we are going to boil hot water to start cooking the Sago.
                To do this we put the desired amount of sago into boiling water and let
                it cook for 10-20 minutes or until the pearls do not have a white center 
                anymore.</li>
            <li>While the sago is cooking, cut the honeydew into bite size pieces and put into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove the liquids from the Nata de coco and pour the jellies into the bowl.</li>
            <li>When the sago is done cooking, run under cold water until the sago is cold and
                strain and put into our bowl.</li>
            <li>Slice or break apart the coconut pudding and put into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour all the milks into the bowl with the desired amount of each.</li>
            <li>Put ice in serving bowl or into the main bowl and <b>enjoy!</b></li>
        </ol>
