    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The matcha latte is one of my personal favorite drinks that has excellent health
        benefits along with a delicious taste. This latte has subtle hints of earthiness along
        with a sweet creamy taste to it. I find this the perfect alternative for a morning
        cup of coffee. For this recipe, I highly reccomend a ceromonial matcha set for the 
        ideal outcome.
